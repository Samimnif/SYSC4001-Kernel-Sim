## Assignement 1
### Description
For this assignement we created a FCFS Kernel Simulator. It reads data from csv file and ouputs a file with the states changes details for each process. The terminal will also print more detailed information of each process for each clock cycle. We also included a waiting time stats at the end of the program.

```bash
./test1.sh
./test2.sh

In case you get a permission error for the bash files, please change
file permissions
```bash
chmod 755 {filename}
